# Data Normalisation
Normalization is a database design technique used to organize data in a relational
database. It reduces data redundancy and ensures data integrity  
It involves breaking down a large,
complex table into smaller, related tables and
establishing relationships between them.
# Normalization Process
## First Normal Form (1NF)
Ensured that each table has atomic values and no repeating groups.
## Second Normal Form (2NF)
Separated multivalued attributes into different tables.
All non-key attributes depend on the entire primary key.
## Third Normal Form (3NF)
Removed transitive dependencies.
Ensured that non-key attributes depend only on the primary key.
The final design achieves 3NF and avoids redundancy.
